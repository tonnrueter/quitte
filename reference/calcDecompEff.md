# Decomposes a change in a variable based on the changes of its factors (Kaya-like)

Computes decomposition for a change in time or policy of a variable. The
decomposition follows the methodology of the paper: "Some properties of
an exact energy decomposition model", Sun and Ang, 2000, Energy

## Usage

``` r
calcDecompEff(df, x, bau = NULL, pol = NULL, gap = "policy")

calcDecompEff_scen(df, x, bau)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  a quitte object (with coluns model, scenario, region, variable, unit,
  period, value)

- x:

  a character vector detailing the explained variable from the
  decomposition as well as the factors in the decomposition. The
  explained variable should be named "explained" in the character
  vector.

- bau:

  the name of the reference scenario, as a character string. It is
  `NULL` as a default

- pol:

  the name of the policy scenario, as a character string. It is `NULL`
  as a default

- gap:

  either `"policy"` or `"time"`. If `"policy"`, `bau` and `pol` should
  be detailed. If `"time"`, `bau` and `pol` should stay `NULL`.

## Value

A data frame with the effects of each component of the decomposition.
The data frame contains new columns:

- `explained` gives the name of the explained variable

- `factors` gives the name of the factor considered (from the
  decomposition chain)

- `type` gives the parameters:

  - `eff` is the result of the decomposition: how much of the change is
    to be attributed to the factor

  - `value` is the value of the factor

  - `lag` is the value of the factor in the reference scenario or in the
    previous period

  - `delta` is the difference in the factor's value between the policy
    and the reference, or between one period and another

## Examples

``` r
# In this example, emissions = ue * fe_ue * emi_fe
testdf = inline.data.frame(
  c("scenario ;period; variable; value",

    "reference; 2015 ; emissions; 10",
    "reference; 2015 ; ue       ;  4",
    "reference; 2015 ; fe_ue    ;  2",
    "reference; 2015 ; emi_fe   ;  1.25",

    "reference; 2050 ; emissions; 50",
    "reference; 2050 ; ue       ; 25",
    "reference; 2050 ; fe_ue    ;  1.25",

)
testdf = as.quitte(testdf)
decomposition_chain = c(explained = "emissions", "ue","fe_ue","emi_fe")

result = calcDecompEff(testdf,x = decomposition_chain,gap = "time")
